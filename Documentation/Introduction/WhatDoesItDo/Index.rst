What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension allows users to create a one-time FE account to which
they will be automatically logged in. The users don't need to enter a
user name or password. So this login can be used only one time.

This extension also supports rsaauth and saltedpasswords.

**Note:** This extension is intended to provide one-time FE user
accounts for other extensions. Originally, this extension was created
as a supplement to the extension  *Seminar Manager* (extension key:
*seminars* ), but it can also be used for other extensions without
problems.
