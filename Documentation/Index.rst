This extension provides a Bootstrap-5-compatible form that allows users to
create a one-time FE account to which they will be automatically logged in
(without having to enter a username or password).

It is often used together with the
`seminars extension <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/seminars>`__,
allowing attendees to sign up for events without having to create an account.
