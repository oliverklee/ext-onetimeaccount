==================================================
What does this extension do, and how does it work?
==================================================

This plugin is intended to be used for cases where a having user data is
required for certain parts of the process (e.g., signing up for a course) using
the `seminars extension <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/seminars>`__,
but where users should be allowed to enter their personal data without having to
go through the process of creating a front-end user account.

Technically, the extension provides a form for the user to enter their data.
It then creates a new front-end user account for the user with an autogenerated
username and password. The UID of the newly-created user then will be stored in
the session, allowing the seminars registration form to recognize that the use
has provided their data. (The FE user will not be auto-logged in, though.)
The user is then automatically redirected to the page provided in the
:code:`redirect_url` GET parameter (the same way the normal front-end login
process works).

The onetimeaccount plugin can be used on the login page either next to the
normal login form or instead of it (if a FE login is not relevant).

CAPTCHA
=======

To avoid garbage FE user records, this extension can be configured to use a
CAPTCHA.
