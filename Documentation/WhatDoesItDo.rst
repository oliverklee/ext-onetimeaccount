==================================================
What does this extension do, and how does it work?
==================================================

This extension is intended to be used for cases where a front-end login is
required for certain parts of the site (e.g., signing up for a course) using the
`seminars extension <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/seminars>`__), but
where users should be allowed to enter their personal data without having to
go through the process of creating a front-end user account.

Technically, the extension provides a form for the user to enter their data.
It then creates a new front-end user account for the user with an autogenerated
username and password. The user is then automatically logged in and redirected
to the page provided  in the :code:`redirect_url` GET parameter (the same way
the normal front-end login process works).

The onetimeaccount autologin also sets a flag in the user session that allows
the seminars extension to recognize a login to be a one-time login and then
automatically log the user out again after they have finished signing up for
an event.

The onetimeaccount plugin can be used on the login page either next to the
normal login form or instead of it.
