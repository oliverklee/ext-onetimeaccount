This extension allows users to create a one-time FE account to which they will
be automatically logged in (without having to enter a user name or password).

Most of the documentation is in ReST format
[in the Documentation/ folder](Documentation/) and is rendered
[as part of the TYPO3 documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/onetimeaccount/).

## Compatibility with TYPO3 10LTS/10.4

This extension is not compatible TYPO3 with 10LTS/10.4 yet.
Please consider supporting the
[crowdfunding campaign](https://github.com/oliverklee/ext-seminars/wiki/10LTS-Crowdfunding-Campaign)
to make this happen.

## Give it a try!

If you would like to test the extension yourself, there is a
[DDEV-based TYPO3 distribution](https://github.com/oliverklee/TYPO3-testing-distribution)
with this extension installed and some test records ready to go.
